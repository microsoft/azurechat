# What's new - 2025

A new year brings some much requested feature updates to one of our most popular AI chat repos!

- **[Managed Identity-based security](/docs/9-managed-identities.md)**. This uses Azure's underlying RBAC and removes (almost) all keys/secrets.
- `appreg_setup.ps1` and `appreg_setup.sh` helper scripts to **[create the App Registration for you](/docs/3-add-identity.md#entra-id-authentication-provider)** in Entra ID (if you have the permissions). Less copypasta means happier devs ðŸ¥°
- Added support for private endpoints and ESLZ compliant deployment

# Introduction

_Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure OpenAI Service_

![Intro Image](/docs/images/intro.png)

_Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure OpenAI Service_ is a solution accelerator that allows organisations to deploy a private chat tenant in their Azure Subscription, with a familiar user experience and the added capabilities of chatting over your data and files.

Benefits are:

1. **Private:** Deployed in your Azure tenancy, allowing you to isolate it to your Azure tenant.

2. **Controlled:** Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade authentication security features are built in.

3. **Value:** Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).

# Deploy to Azure

You can provision Azure resources for the solution accelerator using either the Azure Developer CLI or the Deploy to Azure button below. Regardless of the method you chose you will still need set up an [identity provider and specify an admin user](/docs/3-add-identity.md).

We recommend you also read the dedicated [Deploy to Azure](./docs/4-deploy-to-azure.md) documentation to understand how to deploy the application using GitHub Actions.

## Deployment Options

You can deploy the application using one of the following options:

- [1. Azure Developer CLI](#azure-developer-cli)
- [2. Azure Portal Deployment](#azure-portal-deployment)

### 1. Azure Developer CLI (Resource group scoped deployment)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section will create Azure resources and deploy the solution from your local environment using the Azure Developer CLI. Note that you do not need to clone this repo to complete these steps.

1. Download the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
1. Enable Resource Group scoping for `azd` based deployments to target the deployment scope to resource group from defalt subscription scope by executing `azd config set alpha.resourceGroupDeployments on`. Note that [this feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/resource-group-scoped-deployments) is still in early stages of deveopment.
1. Set the environment variables for pointing the deployment to the resource group by running `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP <existing-rg-name>`. In case you don't have existing resource groups, you can create one using [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#create-resource-groups) or [CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli#create-resource-groups).
1. If you have not cloned this repo, run `azd init -t microsoft/azurechat`. If you have cloned this repo, just run `azd init` from the repo root directory.
1. Run `azd up` to provision and deploy the application

```pwsh
azd init -t microsoft/azurechat
azd up

# if you are wanting to see logs run with debug flag
azd up --debug
```

### 2. Azure Portal Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> This button will only create Azure resources. You will still need to deploy the application by following the [deploy to Azure section](/docs/4-deploy-to-azure.md) to build and deploy the application using GitHub actions.

Click on the Deploy to Azure button to deploy the Azure resources for the application.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/anzappazurechatgpt)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The application is protected by an identity provider, follow the steps in [Add an identity provider](/docs/3-add-identity.md) section for adding authentication to your app.
