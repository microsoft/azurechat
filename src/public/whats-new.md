## 👨🏻‍💻 Version 1.3.8 Updates - 15 APR 2024

## 🛡️ Version 1.3.7 Updates - 12 APR 2024

- **Enhanced Content Safety Measures:** This update introduces significant improvements to our content safety protocols. QChat will now more effectively identify messages that potentially breach our content safety guidelines. Such messages will be flagged with a clear warning. Furthermore, if three messages in a conversation are flagged for content safety violations, the ongoing conversation will be locked to prevent the exchange of new messages. We encourage users to make use of the feedback options provided if they encounter any messages that they believe should have been flagged but were not. This helps us continually refine and enhance our content safety measures.

## 🆕 Version 1.3.5 Updates - 5 APR 2024

- **Display Name Context:** Since version 1.3.5, QChat now has access to your Display Name as additional context when responding to you. This enhancement aims to personalise your interaction with QChat further.

## ✨ New Features

- **Copy Chat to Clipboard & Export Documents:** You can now easily copy your chat to the clipboard or export it as a document for your records. These options are available next to the text input bar in the chat interface.
- **Watermarking:** Please note that text copied from QChat has watermarking. It indicates "Text generated by QChat," and for code, it says "Code Language generated by QChat," with the note being commented out. This feature helps identify the source of the information for reference and integrity.

## 🚀 UI and Accessibility Improvements

- Significant UI and accessibility changes have been made to ensure a more user-friendly and inclusive experience for all users. These improvements aim to enhance navigation, readability, and overall interaction with QChat.

This feature supports uploading files to existing chats, enabling multiple file interactions within a single chat session. Citations within responses are visible, and you can click on them for related context.
