## 👨🏻‍💻 Version 1.4.1 Updates - 26 APR 2024

- **Display Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Feature:** A new feature was introduced to calculate the readability scores, which reflects the education grade level required to comprehend the text. For example, a score of 8 means that an eighth grader can understand the document (typically around 13-14 years old). For most documents, please aim for a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score that corresponds to a reading age of 12 or below. Adding five to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score provides the approximate reading age of your document.

## 🛡️ Version 1.3.7 Updates - 12 APR 2024

- **Enhanced Content Safety Measures:** This update introduces significant improvements to our content safety protocols. QChat will now more effectively identify messages that potentially breach our content safety guidelines. Such messages will be flagged with a clear warning. Furthermore, if three messages in a conversation are flagged for content safety violations, the ongoing conversation will be locked to prevent the exchange of new messages. We encourage users to make use of the feedback options provided if they encounter any messages that they believe should have been flagged but were not. This helps us continually refine and enhance our content safety measures.

- **Watermarking:** Please note that text copied from QChat has watermarking. It indicates "Text generated by QChat," and for code, it says "Code Language generated by QChat," with the note being commented out. This feature helps identify the source of the information for reference and integrity.
